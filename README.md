# 🏋️ FITillegence — AI-Powered Personal Fitness Companion

> A capstone project demonstrating Generative AI, prompt engineering, and full-stack development.
> Built by **Fortu Alexandra Andrea S.**

FITillegence is a localhost web application that delivers personalized workout plans, diet recommendations, and wellness advice using **Groq's Llama 3.3 70B** model. Its standout feature is a **prompt-engineering comparison dashboard** that lets users see how four different prompting strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) change the AI's output in real time.

## 🧠 Prompt Engineering Strategies

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Zero-Shot** | Direct instruction, no examples. Tests baseline model knowledge. |
| **Few-Shot** | Provides one worked example to anchor format and depth. |
| **Chain-of-Thought** | Walks the model through BMR → TDEE → macros → split before answering. |
| **Role-Based** | Casts the model as "Coach Alex," a 15-year veteran trainer. |

See `docs/PROMPT_ENGINEERING.md` for full prompt text and analysis.
